        <p>Women’s football is increasing its popularity but there’s still a big disparity when compared with male sports.</p><br>
        <p>There’s discrimination in men’s football as well, especially when it comes to racial and gender issues. Although, when we speak about women’s football, it is easily recognizable that these issues are more prominent, mainly because it is not an aspect of the sport as credible and because it’s not rooted within our culture. In addition, there are other problems such as conditions and salary inequality, sexism (publicity, social networks, equipment, brands, etc.), funding and professional structures.</p><br>
        <p>Table football is a game in which all the players look the same apart from the fact they are split into two teams by the colors on their jerseys. They are equal. There’s no imbalances and inequalities. The only thing that differs which play in the game is the ability of the human being beside each knob.</p><br>
        <p>In order to show the audience that there should be no gender disparity in sport but especially in football, I have decided to create an advertisement based on the concept of the football table.</p>
