        <p>Women’s football is increasing its popularity but there’s still a big disparity when compared with male sports.</p><br>
        <p>There’s discrimination in men’s football as well, especially when it comes to racial and gender issues. Although, when we speak about women’s football, it is easily recognizable that these issues are more prominent, mainly because it is not an aspect of the sport as credible and because it’s not rooted within our culture. In addition, there are other problems such as conditions and salary inequality, sexism (publicity, social networks, equipment, brands, etc.), funding and professional structures.</p><br>
        <p>Table football is a game in which all the players look the same apart from the fact they are split into two teams by the colors on their jerseys. They are equal. There’s no imbalances and inequalities. The only thing that differs which play in the game is the ability of the human being beside each knob.</p><br>
        <p>In order to show the audience that there should be no gender disparity in sport but especially in football, I have decided to create an advertisement based on the concept of the football table.</p>

        <p>The primary objective of this campaign is to persuade our audience to believe that there must not be a gender gap in football, or any other sport. We all need the same conditions because we are all capable of reaching the same goals, despite all the characteristics that distinguish the individuals from the rest of society.</p> <br>

            <p>Table football is a game in which all the players look the same apart from the fact that they are split into two teams by the colors on their jerseys. They are equal. There’s no imbalances and inequalities. The only thing that matters in the game is the ability of the human being behind the knob.</p> <br>

            <p>This table football is composed of a men’s team and a women’s team. The eleven players that make the women’s team are completely different from each other. They have different physical and motor characteristics but the same ability to play the game. The same thing happens in the men’s team.</p> <br>

            <p>Another difference between the teams is the sponsored equipment. Ten out of the eleven men have visible brands in their equipment, while only one woman has that privilege.</p>
