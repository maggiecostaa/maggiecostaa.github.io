<p>This project consisted of creating an outcome for the Penguin Student Design Award briefing. It consisted of creating a cover design for one of the three purposed categories. The one I chose to take part in was: Wonder by R.J.Palacio in the Children’s Cover Category.</p><br>

<p>
The characteristics that I was looking to reach with my cover are: minimalistic, typographical, dynamic and eye-catching.</p><br>

<p>
There were two quotes that grabbed my attention and that I decided to use as the moto for my design “our face is the map that shows us where we are going and where we have been” and “we are all plans orbiting the sun”.</p><br>

<p>
 After going through the points required for the contest I realized that an imaginative and out of ordinary approach was required. For that, I decided to stay with the astrology theme but not using the helmet as an element. 
Auggie is the center of the universe of the Pullman family, and all the other members’ life lives around him, all except Daisy, the family dog.</p> <br>

<p>The typography used for the names was hand-drawn by me, adding more dynamism to the composition.</p>
